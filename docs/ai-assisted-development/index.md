description: Build Marko apps with first-class AI agent support via devai, MCP tools, and LSP completions.
---

Marko ships first-class AI agent support out of the box. The `marko/devai` installer wires up MCP tools, LSP features, and per-agent guidelines for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, and JetBrains Junie.

## The trio

Three packages work together to give every supported agent a complete picture of your Marko project:

- **`marko/devai`** — Installer and orchestrator. Run `marko devai:install` once to detect every agent you have configured and write the correct integration files automatically.
- **`marko/mcp`** — An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server providing 13 always-registered tools plus conditional `query_database` and `search_docs` tools. Started via `marko mcp:serve`.
- **`marko/lsp`** — A Language Server Protocol implementation providing completions, hover, go-to-definition, diagnostics, and code lens for Marko-specific symbols. Started via `marko lsp:serve`.

Together, these three packages give agents accurate, project-specific context without requiring any manual prompt engineering.

## Quick start

```bash
composer require --dev marko/devai
marko devai:install
```

`devai:install` inspects your environment, detects which agents are present, and writes the necessary configuration files for each one. See the [Installation guide](./installation/) for the full walkthrough.

## Editing generated files

Every guideline file devai generates — `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `junie/guidelines.md`, `.cursor/rules/marko.mdc` — is **yours to edit**. devai only owns the content inside a marker block:

```
<!-- BEGIN marko:devai -->
…devai-managed guidelines…
<!-- END marko:devai -->
```

- A file that doesn't exist yet is **created** with the markers in place.
- Re-running `marko devai:install` or `marko devai:update` rewrites **only the content between the markers** — anything you add above or below them is preserved verbatim.
- **Remove the markers** (or hand-author a file that never had them) and devai **backs off entirely**: it stops managing that file and logs a notice. That's the full-ownership escape hatch — no lock-in.

This behaves identically for every agent. (`.cursor/rules/marko.mdc` keeps its YAML frontmatter as the first line, with the marker block below it.)

## What each package provides

### marko/devai

- Single `devai:install` command that auto-detects Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI, and Junie
- Writes agent-specific configuration files as editable marker blocks (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/marko.mdc`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `junie/guidelines.md`, etc.) — see [Editing generated files](#editing-generated-files)
- Registers the MCP server with each agent that supports it (via config file or CLI command depending on the agent)
- Distributes per-package guidelines and skills from `resources/ai/` directories across your installed packages

### marko/mcp

Provides callable tools over the Model Context Protocol so agents can query your project at runtime. Thirteen tools are always available, with two registered conditionally:

| Tool | Notes |
|---|---|
| `check_config_key` | Verify a config key exists in the index |
| `find_event_observers` | List observers registered for a given event |
| `find_plugins_targeting` | List plugins targeting a given class |
| `get_config_schema` | Return the schema for a config namespace |
| `list_commands` | List all registered console commands |
| `list_modules` | List all installed Marko modules |
| `list_routes` | List all registered routes |
| `resolve_preference` | Resolve the concrete class bound to an interface |
| `resolve_template` | Resolve the file path for a template name |
| `validate_module` | Check a module for structural errors |
| `app_info` | Return application name and installed package versions |
| `read_log_entries` | Read recent log entries; `read_log_entries(level: 'error', limit: 1)` returns the most recent error |
| `run_console_command` | Run a console command and return its output |
| `query_database` | Conditional — requires `marko/database` |
| `search_docs` | Conditional — requires a `DocsSearchInterface` binding |

See the [MCP reference](./mcp/) for the full list with return types and parameters, and the [LSP reference](./lsp/) for editor-side code intel.

### marko/lsp

Provides IDE-style completions, hover, go-to-definition, diagnostics, and code lens inside any editor with LSP support:

- Config key completions, hover documentation, and go-to-definition
- Template name completions and go-to-definition
- Translation key completions and go-to-definition
- Attribute parameter completions
- Inline diagnostics for invalid config keys, templates, and translation keys

See the [`marko/lsp` README](https://github.com/markshust/marko/tree/develop/packages/lsp) for the full feature list.

## Skills, MCP, LSP — when does each kick in?

The three primitives sit at different layers of "what does the agent need from your project". Use this decision tree when you wonder where a new piece of help belongs:

| Layer | Purpose | Triggered by | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LSP** | What's in the code right now | Editor request (cursor position, completion trigger) | `config('cache.` → completions for valid cache config keys |
| **MCP** | A capability or non-trivial lookup the agent should be able to invoke | The agent decides it needs the result | Agent calls `find_plugins_targeting` to see what intercepts a class |
| **Skill** | The Marko-specific workflow for a multi-step task | The agent matches the user's request against the skill's `description` frontmatter | User says "create a Marko module" → agent loads `/marko-skills:create-module` (Claude Code plugin invocation) and follows it |

In flat terms:

- **LSP** = "what's in the code"
- **MCP** = "do this thing or look this up"
- **Skill** = "how do I do X the Marko way"

A fourth, lighter, layer exists alongside these:

- **Per-package guidelines** (`resources/ai/guidelines.md`) — short prescriptive rules merged into `AGENTS.md`. Always in context, no on-demand loading. Use sparingly: every line competes with the user's own code for the agent's attention.

### Choosing the right layer for new help

1. Is it factual code intel an editor would normally show (completions, definitions, hover)? → **LSP feature**.
2. Is it an action or non-trivial computation the agent needs to invoke at runtime (search, validate, query)? → **MCP tool**.
3. Is it a multi-step convention with judgment calls the agent would otherwise get wrong? → **Skill**.
4. Is it a one-line always-on rule? → **Per-package `guidelines.md`**.

Skill descriptions matter: Claude (and other agents that auto-load skills) decide whether to pull a skill in based on the `description` field in the SKILL.md frontmatter. Vague descriptions = skills that never load. Name the trigger conditions concretely: *"Use whenever the user asks to create a plugin, intercept a method, modify input arguments, or short-circuit a method call."*
