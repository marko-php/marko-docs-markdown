description: Fix common install failures, ONNX download issues, and agent registration problems for Marko's AI tooling.
---

This page covers the most common issues encountered when setting up `marko/devai`, `marko/mcp`, and `marko/lsp`.

## Installation failures

### "marko command not found" after composer require

The `marko` binary is published to `vendor/bin/`. If you don't already have it on your `PATH` from a global install, add the project's `vendor/bin/` to your shell:

```bash
export PATH="vendor/bin:$PATH"
```

Or invoke the binary by its project-local path: `./vendor/bin/marko ...`.

### devai:install exits with "No agents detected"

The installer detects agents by looking for known configuration files and binaries. If no agents are found:

1. Confirm the agent's CLI is on your `PATH` (e.g., `claude`, `codex`, `gemini` for the agents that gate detection on a binary).
2. Bypass detection and force a specific agent set with the `--agents` flag (comma-separated, no space):

```bash
marko devai:install --agents=claude-code,codex
```

Supported agent identifiers: `claude-code`, `codex`, `cursor`, `copilot`, `gemini-cli`, `junie`.

### Permission denied writing agent files

If the installer cannot write `CLAUDE.md` or other files, check directory permissions:

```bash
ls -la . | head -5
```

If running inside a container or mounted volume, ensure the working directory is writable by the PHP process.

## ONNX download issues (docs-vec driver)

### Download hangs or times out

The ONNX embedding model is downloaded by `marko docs-vec:download-model` and lives inside the `marko/docs-vec` package directory. If the download hangs:

1. Check your network connection and proxy settings.
2. Re-run the command — it skips files that already exist with a matching checksum, so a partial download can be resumed by deleting just the partial file.

### "FFI not enabled" error with docs-vec

The `docs-vec` driver requires PHP's FFI extension. Check if it is enabled:

```bash
php -m | grep -i ffi
```

If FFI is missing, either enable it in `php.ini`:

```ini
extension=ffi
ffi.enable=true
```

Or switch to the `docs-fts` driver, which has no FFI requirement. The driver is selected by which package your app installs (`marko/docs-fts` vs `marko/docs-vec`); see [Docs driver comparison](./docs-drivers/).

### "ONNX model checksum mismatch"

If the downloaded model file is corrupted, delete it from the `marko/docs-vec` package's model directory and re-run:

```bash
marko docs-vec:download-model
marko docs-vec:build
```

## MCP server problems

### Agent reports "MCP server failed to start"

1. Confirm `marko mcp:serve` runs without error:

```bash
marko mcp:serve
# Should block waiting for stdin — press Ctrl+C to exit
```

2. Check the agent's MCP configuration file references the correct command:

```json
{
  "command": "marko",
  "args": ["mcp:serve"]
}
```

3. Ensure the `marko` binary is on the `PATH` the agent uses. Some agents (e.g., Claude Code) launch their MCP servers in a restricted environment. If `marko` is not on the agent's `PATH`, point the registration at the absolute path of the binary:

```json
{
  "command": "/absolute/path/to/marko",
  "args": ["mcp:serve"]
}
```

### "Tool not found" when calling search_docs

The `search_docs` tool is only registered when a `DocsSearchInterface` binding is present. This requires installing a docs driver package such as `marko/docs-fts` or `marko/docs-vec`. If neither is installed, the tool will not appear in the MCP tool list regardless of the index state.

If the tool is listed but returns no results, the index may be stale. Trigger a rebuild:

```bash
marko indexer:rebuild
```

The `IndexCache` also rebuilds automatically on next read if any tracked source file is newer than the cache.

### "Tool not found" when calling query_database

The `query_database` tool is only registered when `marko/database` is bound in the container. Install the database package and ensure it is configured before expecting this tool to appear.

## LSP problems

### No completions appearing in the editor

1. Confirm `marko lsp:serve` runs:

```bash
marko lsp:serve
# Should block waiting for stdin — press Ctrl+C
```

2. Check the editor's LSP configuration points to `marko lsp:serve`.

3. In VS Code: open the Output panel, select "Marko Language Server" from the dropdown — connection errors appear here.

4. In PhpStorm: check **Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Language Servers** for connection status.

### Completions appear but are stale or incorrect

The MCP and LSP servers lazy-load `.marko/index.cache` and rebuild it whenever a watched source file is newer than the cache, so completions usually self-heal. If they don't, force a clean rebuild:

```bash
marko indexer:rebuild
```

## Agent registration problems

### CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md not updated after re-running devai:install

A second `marko devai:install` run is a no-op once `.marko/devai.json` exists — the orchestrator prints "Prior install detected at .marko/devai.json. Use `marko devai:update` to update, or pass --force to re-run." To force a refresh:

```bash
marko devai:install --force
```

This regenerates the Marko section in every agent guidelines file based on the current set of installed packages.

### Guidelines from a newly installed package are not appearing

After adding a new package, re-run the installer:

```bash
composer require my-vendor/my-package
marko devai:install
```

The installer reads `resources/ai/guidelines.md` from every package in `vendor/` each time it runs.
