Gates, policies, and the `#[Can]` attribute --- control who can do what with expressive, testable authorization checks. Define abilities with closures via the Gate, or organize them into policy classes mapped to entities. Use `#[Can]` on controllers or their methods to enforce permissions through middleware that runs on every route once the package is installed. Denials throw `AuthorizationException` with clear context.

## Installation

```bash
composer require marko/authorization
```

## Usage

### Defining Abilities

Register abilities as closures on the Gate:

```php
use Marko\Authorization\AuthorizableInterface;
use Marko\Authorization\Contracts\GateInterface;

readonly class AuthorizationBootstrap
{
    public function __construct(
        private GateInterface $gate,
    ) {}

    public function boot(): void
    {
        $this->gate->define(
            'edit-settings',
            fn (?AuthorizableInterface $user) => $user?->can('admin', true) ?? false,
        );
    }
}
```

### Checking Abilities

```php
use Marko\Authorization\Contracts\GateInterface;

readonly class SettingsController
{
    public function __construct(
        private GateInterface $gate,
    ) {}

    public function update(): void
    {
        if ($this->gate->denies('edit-settings')) {
            // handle unauthorized
        }

        // proceed with update
    }
}
```

Use `authorize()` to throw on denial:

```php
$this->gate->authorize('edit-settings');
// Throws AuthorizationException if denied
```

You don't need to catch it in a controller. `AuthorizationException` implements `HttpExceptionInterface`, so the routing pipeline turns an uncaught denial into a `403` (see [Failure Responses](#failure-responses)).

### Using Policies

Policies group authorization logic per entity. Create a policy class with methods named after abilities:

```php
use Marko\Authorization\AuthorizableInterface;

class PostPolicy
{
    public function update(
        ?AuthorizableInterface $user,
        Post $post,
    ): bool {
        return $user !== null && $user->getAuthIdentifier() === $post->authorId;
    }

    public function delete(
        ?AuthorizableInterface $user,
        Post $post,
    ): bool {
        return $user !== null && $user->getAuthIdentifier() === $post->authorId;
    }
}
```

Register the policy:

```php
$this->gate->policy(
    Post::class,
    PostPolicy::class,
);
```

Check against the policy by passing the entity:

```php
$this->gate->authorize('update', $post);
```

### The #[Can] Attribute

Add `#[Can]` to a controller method to require an ability before the action runs:

```php
use Marko\Authorization\Attributes\Can;
use Marko\Routing\Attributes\Get;
use Marko\Routing\Attributes\Post as PostRoute;
use Marko\Routing\Http\Response;

class PostController
{
    #[Get('/admin/stats')]
    #[Can('view-stats')]
    public function stats(): Response
    {
        // Only reachable if the gate allows 'view-stats'
    }

    #[PostRoute('/posts')]
    #[Can(ability: 'create', entityClass: Post::class)]
    public function store(): Response
    {
        // Only reachable if PostPolicy::create() allows it
    }
}
```

Installing `marko/authorization` registers `AuthorizationMiddleware` as global middleware, so you don't attach it to routes yourself. For every matched route it reads `#[Can]` from the controller action and checks the Gate:

- **No `#[Can]`**: the request passes through untouched.
- **Not logged in**: throws `UnauthenticatedException` (from `marko/authentication`), which renders as `401 Unauthorized`. When the guard is stateless, such as the [token guard](/docs/packages/authentication-token/), the `401` carries the guard's `WWW-Authenticate` challenge (`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`), exactly as `AuthMiddleware` sends it.
- **Logged in but denied**: throws `AuthorizationException`, which renders as `403 Forbidden`.

The middleware never builds these responses itself; see [Failure Responses](#failure-responses).

The middleware checks authentication with the same guard the Gate uses, so the guard named by `authorization.default_guard` decides whether the request gets a `401`. If that value is `null`, the authentication default guard is used.

Don't also list `AuthorizationMiddleware` in a route's `middleware` array. It already runs globally, so it would only check the same ability a second time.

#### Cost on Routes Without `#[Can]`

The middleware builds the Gate and the guard lazily, the first time it sees a route with `#[Can]`. For a route without `#[Can]`, and for a request that matches no route (`404`/`405`), `AuthorizationMiddleware` never resolves the Gate, the `AuthManager`, the guard or the authorization config. Those requests cost one cached attribute lookup, and they work even when authentication isn't configured. You can install `marko/authorization` just to call the Gate from a CLI command or a service without setting up the authentication stack. (An installed session driver still runs its own `SessionMiddleware` on every request; that is independent of `#[Can]`.)

A route with `#[Can]` needs the full stack:

- An authentication guard: `authorization.default_guard`, or the authentication default guard when that value is `null`, must name a guard defined under `authentication.guards`.
- A `UserProviderInterface` binding, so the guard can load the logged-in user.
- A session driver (such as `marko/session-file` or `marko/session-database`) when that guard is a session guard.
- A `TokenRepositoryInterface` binding when that guard is the `token` guard from [`marko/authentication-token`](/docs/packages/authentication-token/).

The middleware never needs this stack for routes without `#[Can]`, but the boot checks it when any route uses `#[Can]`, so a broken setup fails before the first user reaches the route:

- **Live boots** (the `development` environment, or no discovery cache): after every module's `boot` callback has run, `marko/authorization` lists the routes that carry `#[Can]` and keep `AuthorizationMiddleware`. If there are any, it builds the guard once (`authorization.default_guard`, else `authentication.default.guard`). A guard name missing from `authentication.guards`, such as a typo in either setting, fails here too, because `AuthManager` throws for an undefined guard instead of building a session guard. When that fails, the boot throws `Marko\Authorization\Exceptions\AuthorizationConfigurationException`. Its message names the guard and the underlying error, its context lists up to five `#[Can]` routes, and the original exception is kept as `getPrevious()`. The check runs after all boot callbacks (on the core `ApplicationBooted` event), so a guard driver that any module registers in its `boot` callback is already there.
- **`marko discovery:cache`**: the command always boots live, so it fails with the same exception and writes no cache. A broken setup never reaches a cached deploy.
- **Cached boots** (production, from the discovery cache) skip the check entirely: no route reflection, no guard. Under PHP-FPM every request is a boot, so the check would otherwise put back the per-request cost that lazy building avoids. The cache was compiled by a live boot that passed the check.

The check is skipped when no route uses `#[Can]`, and for a `#[Can]` route that excludes `AuthorizationMiddleware` with `#[WithoutMiddleware]`. Apps that use the Gate only from services or commands still boot without any authentication configuration. Every live boot runs the check, CLI commands included, so in development a broken setup also stops commands such as `marko discovery:clear` until it is fixed.

What remains at request time: the Gate is still built lazily on the first `#[Can]` request, so a guard swapped in after boot (as the HTTP test client's `actingAs()` does) is the one it authorizes with. If the environment changes after the cache was compiled (for example a binding that now fails), a cached boot doesn't notice. The first request to a `#[Can]` route then fails with the container or config error that names what is missing, while routes without `#[Can]` keep working. A failed build is not cached, so the next `#[Can]` request tries again. The Gate and guard are built once per middleware instance, so a long-running worker builds them on its first `#[Can]` request and reuses them after that.

#### Class-Level `#[Can]`

Put `#[Can]` on the controller class to protect every action in it. A `#[Can]` on a method replaces the class-level one for that action:

```php
use Marko\Authorization\Attributes\Can;
use Marko\Routing\Attributes\Get;
use Marko\Routing\Http\Response;

#[Can('admin.access')]
class AdminController
{
    #[Get('/admin')]
    public function dashboard(): Response
    {
        // Requires 'admin.access'
    }

    #[Get('/admin/reports')]
    #[Can('admin.reports')]
    public function reports(): Response
    {
        // Requires 'admin.reports' only
    }
}
```

PHP attributes are not inherited, so a class-level `#[Can]` applies only to the class that declares it, not to its subclasses. Repeat it on a subclass that needs the same protection.

#### Ordering with Sessions

The guard reads the logged-in user from the session, so authorization runs after the session middleware. `marko/authorization` declares `sequence.after` on `marko/session-file` and `marko/session-database`, the session drivers that register `SessionMiddleware` globally. Drivers that aren't installed are ignored.

#### Class-String vs Instance Checks

With `entityClass`, `#[Can]` passes the class name (for example `Post::class`) to the Gate, not an entity. The Gate resolves the policy from the class name, so this fits abilities that don't need a specific record, such as `create` or `viewAny`:

```php
use Marko\Authorization\AuthorizableInterface;

class PostPolicy
{
    public function create(
        ?AuthorizableInterface $user,
        string $postClass,
    ): bool {
        return $user !== null;
    }
}
```

Abilities that depend on a specific record, such as `update` or `delete` on one post, need the loaded entity. Marko has no route model binding (explicit over implicit), so load the entity in the controller and call `authorize()` yourself:

```php
use Marko\Authorization\Contracts\GateInterface;
use Marko\Routing\Attributes\Put;
use Marko\Routing\Http\Response;

readonly class PostController
{
    public function __construct(
        private GateInterface $gate,
        private PostRepository $posts,
    ) {}

    #[Put('/posts/{id}')]
    public function update(
        int $id,
    ): Response {
        $post = $this->posts->find($id);
        $this->gate->authorize('update', $post);

        // proceed with update
    }
}
```

### Failure Responses

Authorization failures are thrown as exceptions that implement `Marko\Core\Exceptions\HttpExceptionInterface`. The routing pipeline renders them through [`ExceptionRenderer`](/docs/packages/routing/#errors-and-http-exceptions), in the same way as every other HTTP error:

| Failure | Thrown by | Exception | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `#[Can]` route, no authenticated user | `AuthorizationMiddleware` | `Marko\Authentication\Exceptions\UnauthenticatedException` (an `HttpException`) | `401`, with the guard's `WWW-Authenticate` challenge when the guard is [stateless](/docs/packages/authentication/#stateless-guards) |
| `#[Can]` route, ability denied | `AuthorizationMiddleware` | `Marko\Authorization\Exceptions\AuthorizationException` | `403` |
| `$gate->authorize()` denied in a controller or service | `Gate` | `Marko\Authorization\Exceptions\AuthorizationException` | `403` |

The renderer picks the format from the request. It sends JSON when the `Accept` header asks for `application/json` or any `+json` type (such as `application/vnd.api+json`), or when the request has a JSON `Content-Type` and no `Accept` header. Otherwise it sends a minimal HTML page:

```json
{"message": "Unauthorized."}
{"message": "Forbidden."}
```

The `403` body never contains the ability or the resource name, because they can leak internals. Both stay on the exception for logging, through `getAbility()` and `getResource()`.

A `Gate` has no notion of a guest. A denied `authorize()` call is always a `403`, even when nobody is logged in. Use `#[Can]` (or [`AuthMiddleware`](/docs/packages/authentication/#authmiddleware)) when a guest should get a `401`.

To render branded error pages or a different JSON shape, replace `ExceptionRenderer` with a `#[Preference]`. See [Custom error pages](/docs/packages/routing/#custom-error-pages) in the routing docs. Authorization failures go through it like any other HTTP error, so nothing authorization-specific is needed.

Mistakes in policy setup are a different case: registering two policies for one entity, or checking an ability the policy has no method for. These throw `PolicyException`, which does **not** implement `HttpExceptionInterface`. It reaches your error handler as a `500` with the full message, instead of being hidden behind a `403`.

### Implementing AuthorizableInterface

Your user entity must implement `AuthorizableInterface`, which extends [`AuthenticatableInterface`](/docs/packages/authentication/):

```php
use Marko\Authorization\AuthorizableInterface;

class User implements AuthorizableInterface
{
    public function can(
        string $ability,
        mixed ...$arguments,
    ): bool {
        // Check ability via gate or custom logic
    }

    public function getAuthIdentifier(): int|string
    {
        return $this->id;
    }

    public function getAuthPassword(): string
    {
        return $this->passwordHash;
    }
}
```

## API Reference

### GateInterface

```php
interface GateInterface
{
    public function define(string $ability, callable $callback): void;
    public function allows(string $ability, mixed ...$arguments): bool;
    public function denies(string $ability, mixed ...$arguments): bool;
    public function authorize(string $ability, mixed ...$arguments): bool;
    public function policy(string $entityClass, string $policyClass): void;
}
```

### AuthorizableInterface

```php
interface AuthorizableInterface extends AuthenticatableInterface
{
    public function can(string $ability, mixed ...$arguments): bool;
}
```

### #[Can] Attribute

```php
#[Can(ability: 'edit', entityClass: Post::class)]  // With entity
#[Can(ability: 'access-dashboard')]                  // Without entity
```

Targets classes and methods. A method-level `#[Can]` overrides a class-level one.

### AuthorizationMiddleware

Registered as global middleware by `module.php`. It reads the matched controller and action from the request. The constructor takes factories, not instances, so the Gate and guard are built only on the first route with `#[Can]`.

```php
class AuthorizationMiddleware implements MiddlewareInterface
{
    /**
     * @param Closure(): GateInterface $gate
     * @param Closure(): GuardInterface $guard
     */
    public function __construct(
        Closure $gate,
        Closure $guard,
        CanAttributeReader $canAttributeReader = new CanAttributeReader(),
    );
    public function handle(Request $request, callable $next): Response;
}
```

`Marko\Authorization\Routing\CanAttributeReader::read(string $controller, string $action): ?Can` returns the `#[Can]` that protects an action (the method's, else the class's). The middleware and the boot check share it.

### AuthorizationException

Rendered as `403` with `{"message": "Forbidden."}`. The ability and resource are never sent to the client.

```php
class AuthorizationException extends MarkoException implements HttpExceptionInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        string $message = 'Forbidden',
        string $ability = '',
        string $resource = '',
        string $context = '',
        string $suggestion = '',
        ?Throwable $previous = null,
    );

    public function getAbility(): string;
    public function getResource(): string;
    public function getStatusCode(): int;          // 403
    public function getHeaders(): array;           // []
    public function getResponseData(): array;      // ['message' => 'Forbidden.']

    public static function forbidden(string $ability, string $resource): self;
}
```

### PolicyException

Thrown for policy misconfiguration. It is not an HTTP exception, so it surfaces as a `500`.

```php
class PolicyException extends MarkoException
{
    public static function duplicatePolicy(string $entityClass, string $policyClass, string $existing): self;
    public static function missingMethod(string $policyClass, string $ability): self;
}
```

### AuthorizationConfigurationException

Thrown at boot when routes use `#[Can]` but the guard can't be built (see [Cost on Routes Without `#[Can]`](#cost-on-routes-without-can)). It is not an HTTP exception.

```php
class AuthorizationConfigurationException extends MarkoException
{
    /** @param array<int, string> $canRoutes "controller::action" keys */
    public static function cannotBuildForCan(?string $guard, array $canRoutes, Throwable $previous): self;
}
```
