Admin authentication and role-based authorization --- manages admin users, roles, permissions, and access control for the admin panel. The package provides an `AdminUserProvider` that integrates with the [authentication](/docs/packages/authentication/) system, a `PermissionRegistry` for declaring and matching permissions (including wildcards), role and permission entities with repository interfaces, and `AdminAuthMiddleware` that enforces `#[RequiresPermission]` checks on controller methods. Super admin roles bypass all permission checks.

## Installation

```bash
composer require marko/admin-auth
```

Then create the tables:

```bash
marko db:migrate
```

The package ships no migration files. Its tables come from its entities, which `db:migrate` discovers in `vendor/marko/admin-auth/src/Entity` like any other module's. In development (or with `--generate`) the command generates a migration for them in `database/migrations/` and applies it; commit that file and deploy it like your own migrations. See [database](/docs/packages/database/) for how migrations are generated.

| Table | Entity | Holds |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `roles` | `Role` | Roles and the `is_super_admin` flag (unique `slug`) |
| `permissions` | `Permission` | Permission keys, labels and groups (unique `key`, index on `group`) |
| `role_permissions` | `RolePermission` | Role to permission assignments (unique `role_id`, `permission_id`; index on `permission_id`) |
| `admin_users` | `AdminUser` | Admin users (unique `email`) |
| `admin_user_roles` | `AdminUserRole` | User to role assignments (unique `user_id`, `role_id`; index on `role_id`) |

Both pivots cascade: deleting a role, permission or admin user deletes its assignment rows.

:::note
Earlier versions shipped hand-written MySQL migrations in `database/migrations/` that `db:migrate` never ran, so `admin_user_roles` was never created and the first admin login failed. If you created the tables from that SQL by hand, the entities differ from them: `role_permissions` and `admin_user_roles` have an auto-increment `id` primary key, `roles.is_super_admin` and `admin_users.is_active` are string columns (`'1'`/`'0'`) instead of `TINYINT(1)`, and the ids and timestamps use the entity column types. Add the two `id` columns yourself first, in a migration of your own:

```sql
ALTER TABLE role_permissions ADD COLUMN id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY FIRST;
ALTER TABLE admin_user_roles ADD COLUMN id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY FIRST;
```

Then `marko db:migrate` generates and applies the remaining column changes. Review the generated migrations before you commit them.

## Usage

### Protecting Admin Routes

Add `AdminAuthMiddleware` to controller methods or classes to require authentication:

```php title="CatalogController.php"
use Marko\AdminAuth\Middleware\AdminAuthMiddleware;
use Marko\Routing\Attributes\Get;
use Marko\Routing\Attributes\Middleware;

class CatalogController
{
    #[Get('/admin/catalog/products')]
    #[Middleware(AdminAuthMiddleware::class)]
    public function index(): Response
    {
        // Only authenticated admin users reach here
    }
}
```

When no admin is logged in, `AdminAuthMiddleware` does one of two things:

- **Redirects** to `{prefix}/login` (`/admin/login` by default) when the guard is stateful (the session guard) and the request does not want JSON.
- **Throws a `401` `UnauthenticatedException`** (an `HttpException` from `marko/authentication`) in every other case: when the request wants JSON (`Request::wantsJson()`: an `Accept` header with `application/json` or a `+json` type), and always when the guard is stateless (`StatelessGuardInterface`, such as the token guard), whatever the `Accept` header, because an API client can't follow a login redirect. On a stateless guard the `401` carries the guard's `WWW-Authenticate` challenge (`Bearer` for the token guard), the same response [`AuthMiddleware`](/docs/packages/authentication/) sends.

`AdminAuthMiddleware` uses the default guard (`GuardInterface`), so an application whose default guard is the token guard, such as a headless admin served through [`marko/admin-api`](/docs/packages/admin-api/), never redirects.

The routing pipeline renders the thrown `401` through [`ExceptionRenderer`](/docs/packages/routing/#errors-and-http-exceptions), so it looks like every other HTTP error in the application:

```json
{"message": "Unauthorized."}
```

### Requiring Permissions

Use `#[RequiresPermission]` to enforce specific permissions on a route. `AdminAuthMiddleware` reads the attribute from the matched controller method via reflection and throws a `403` `HttpException` when the authenticated user lacks the required permission, or is not an admin user at all. Super admin roles bypass this check.

`ExceptionRenderer` renders the `403` as JSON for requests that ask for it and as the application's HTML error page otherwise:

```json
{"message": "Forbidden."}
```

The required permission is never sent to the client. It is only in the exception's context, for logs. To render admin denials differently (a branded page, another JSON shape), replace `ExceptionRenderer` with a `#[Preference]`; see [Custom error pages](/docs/packages/routing/#custom-error-pages). Admin denials go through it like any other HTTP error.

```php title="ProductController.php"
use Marko\AdminAuth\Attributes\RequiresPermission;
use Marko\AdminAuth\Middleware\AdminAuthMiddleware;
use Marko\Routing\Attributes\Get;
use Marko\Routing\Attributes\Middleware;

class ProductController
{
    #[Get('/admin/catalog/products')]
    #[Middleware(AdminAuthMiddleware::class)]
    #[RequiresPermission(permission: 'catalog.products.view')]
    public function index(): Response
    {
        // Only admin users with 'catalog.products.view' permission
    }
}
```

### Registering Permissions

The usual way to declare a permission is `#[AdminPermission]` on an admin section class (see [marko/admin](/docs/packages/admin/)):

```php title="app/catalog/src/Admin/CatalogSection.php"
use Marko\Admin\Attributes\AdminPermission;
use Marko\Admin\Attributes\AdminSection;
use Marko\Admin\Contracts\AdminSectionInterface;

#[AdminSection(id: 'catalog', label: 'Catalog')]
#[AdminPermission(id: 'catalog.products.view', label: 'View Products')]
#[AdminPermission(id: 'catalog.products.edit', label: 'Edit Products')]
class CatalogSection implements AdminSectionInterface
{
    // ...
}
```

You don't register these yourself. `marko/admin-auth`'s boot callback registers every `#[AdminPermission]` on the `#[AdminSection]` classes that [marko/admin](/docs/packages/admin/) discovers. It uses the same section list as marko/admin: one scan per boot, or the discovery cache in production. Each permission's group is the first segment of its key (`catalog` for `catalog.products.view`). Boot fails with an `AdminAuthException` when:

- a key isn't in the [permission key format](#keys-slugs-and-emails) (the message names the key and the section class);
- two section classes declare the same key (the message names both classes);
- a key declared by `#[AdminPermission]` was already registered by hand. Remove the manual `register()` call.

For a permission that doesn't belong to a section, call `PermissionRegistryInterface::register()` from your module's `boot` callback:

```php title="app/catalog/module.php"
use Marko\AdminAuth\Contracts\PermissionRegistryInterface;

return [
    'boot' => function (PermissionRegistryInterface $permissionRegistry): void {
        $permissionRegistry->register(
            key: 'catalog.reports.export',
            label: 'Export Reports',
            group: 'catalog',
        );
    },
];
```

Both ways register in memory only, and boot never touches the database. Roles are assigned permissions from the `permissions` table. After deploying code that adds, changes or removes permissions, write them to the table as described in [Syncing Permissions to the Database](#syncing-permissions-to-the-database).

`marko/admin-auth` binds `PermissionRegistryInterface` to `PermissionRegistry` as a shared singleton, so you don't bind it yourself. Every class that injects the interface gets the same instance: the boot callback, your own boot code, `AdminAuthMiddleware` and `marko/admin-api`'s `SectionController`. A permission registered through one of them is visible to all of them.

To replace the registry, put a `#[Preference]` on a class that implements the interface, and have it replace the interface rather than `PermissionRegistry`. The container checks preferences for the type being injected, which is the interface, so a Preference on the concrete class is never used. The replacement is still shared:

```php title="app/admin/src/AppPermissionRegistry.php"
use Marko\AdminAuth\Contracts\PermissionRegistryInterface;
use Marko\AdminAuth\PermissionRegistry;
use Marko\Core\Attributes\Preference;

#[Preference(replaces: PermissionRegistryInterface::class)]
class AppPermissionRegistry extends PermissionRegistry
{
    // Override register(), all(), getByGroup() or matches() as needed
}
```

### Syncing Permissions to the Database

```bash
marko admin-auth:permissions:sync
```

The command calls `PermissionRepositoryInterface::syncFromRegistry()`, which writes in one transaction:

- It inserts every registered permission that isn't in the table yet.
- It updates the `label` and `group` of an existing row when the `#[AdminPermission]` (or `register()` call) changed them.
- It renames a row whose key differs from a registered key only in letter case (`Posts.Edit` stored, `posts.edit` registered) to the registered key, and reports it as updated. The row keeps its id and role assignments. Without this, the insert would fail on MySQL/MariaDB's case-insensitive unique index and add a second row on PostgreSQL. If several case variants are stored (only possible on PostgreSQL), the one with the lowest id is renamed and the others are reported as unregistered.
- It reports every row whose key is no longer registered (a removed or renamed permission, or an uninstalled module) and how many roles still hold it.
- It deletes nothing.

```
Synced 12 registered permission(s): 1 created, 1 updated, 10 unchanged.
2 permission(s) in the database are no longer registered:
  legacy.reports.export (held by 3 role(s))
  legacy.reports.view (held by 0 role(s))
Re-run with --prune to delete them and their role assignments.
Wildcard grants kept: catalog.*
```

A stale row still grants its key: users with a role that holds it keep the permission, and a later module that registers the same key would hand its new meaning to those roles. Remove stale rows with `--prune`:

```bash
marko admin-auth:permissions:sync --prune
```

`--prune` deletes the unregistered permissions and their `role_permissions` rows in one `transaction()`, then lists what it removed. It deletes the role assignments explicitly, so the result doesn't depend on the foreign key's `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

Keys containing `*` are wildcard grants such as `catalog.*` or `*` (see [Wildcard Permissions](#wildcard-permissions)). `#[AdminPermission]` never registers them, so they are never reported as stale and never pruned. They are listed as "Wildcard grants kept".

Pruning changes what roles can do, so it follows the [destructive command policy](/docs/packages/database/#environment-behaviour) of marko/database, opted in to run in production:

| Environment | `--prune` |
|-------------|-----------|
| `development`, `dev`, `local`, `testing`, `test` | Runs; asks for confirmation first when someone can answer |
| Everything else, including `production` and an unset environment | Refused with exit code 1 unless you also pass `--force`. With `--force`, asks for confirmation when someone can answer, and runs when nobody can (deploy scripts, `--no-interaction`) |

Declining the confirmation cancels the prune with exit code 0; the sync itself has already been written. A deploy script that prunes passes both flags:

```bash
APP_ENV=production marko admin-auth:permissions:sync --prune --force --no-interaction
```

When nothing is stale, `--prune` prints `No unregistered permissions to prune.` and needs no `--force`. The plain sync never deletes anything, so running it on every deploy is safe: a deploy that temporarily disables a module doesn't strip its permissions from roles.

Every run dispatches [`PermissionsSynced`](#events).

### Keys, Slugs and Emails

Permission keys, role slugs and admin emails are unique columns. MySQL and MariaDB compare them with the server's default collation, which ignores case (and accents), while PostgreSQL and PHP compare them exactly (see [String Comparison and Collation](/docs/packages/database/#string-comparison-and-collation)). So that `posts.edit` and `Posts.Edit` mean the same thing on every driver, admin-auth enforces one canonical form in PHP, before any SQL runs:

| Value | Format | Enforced by |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Permission key | Lowercase segments of `a-z`, `0-9`, `_` and `-` separated by dots (`catalog.products.view`). Segments after the first may contain `*` (`catalog.*`, `catalog.products.ed*`), and `*` alone grants everything | `PermissionRegistryInterface::register()`, `#[AdminPermission]` discovery, `PermissionRepository::save()`/`insertBatch()` throw `AdminAuthException::invalidPermissionKey()`; `findByKey()` returns `null` |
| Role slug | Lowercase segments of `a-z`, `0-9`, `_` and `-` separated by dots (`content-editor`), no `*` | `RoleRepository::save()`/`insertBatch()` and `isSlugUnique()` throw `AdminAuthException::invalidRoleSlug()`; `findBySlug()` returns `null` |
| Admin email | Lowercased with `mb_strtolower()` | `AdminUserRepository::save()`/`insertBatch()` store it lowercased and `findByEmail()` looks it up lowercased |

The patterns are `IdentifierFormat::PERMISSION_KEY_PATTERN` and `IdentifierFormat::ROLE_SLUG_PATTERN`; check a value with `IdentifierFormat::isPermissionKey()` or `IdentifierFormat::isRoleSlug()`.

Because emails are lowercased, an admin signs in with `Mark@Example.com` or `mark@example.com` alike on every driver, and saving a second admin whose email differs only in case throws `UniqueConstraintViolationException` on every driver.

:::note
**Upgrading.** Keys and slugs that earlier versions accepted are now rejected:

- A registered or `#[AdminPermission]` key with uppercase letters or spaces fails the boot. Lowercase it in the code. Stored rows that differ from a registered key only in case are renamed by the next `marko admin-auth:permissions:sync`, keeping their role assignments. Any other stored key outside the format (a wildcard grant such as `Catalog.*`) matches nothing; rename it by hand.
- Saving a role whose stored slug is outside the format (such as `Editor`) throws, on every driver. Lowercase the stored slugs (on PostgreSQL, first merge any two slugs that differ only in case, found as for emails below):

  ```sql
  UPDATE roles SET slug = LOWER(slug);
  ```

  Slugs with spaces or other characters need a new slug chosen by hand. Update any code that calls `hasRole()` or `findBySlug()` with the old slug.
- Emails stored with uppercase letters aren't found by `findByEmail()` on PostgreSQL until they are lowercased. PostgreSQL may also hold two case variants of one address, which the `UPDATE` would reject on the unique index, so find and merge those first:

  ```sql
  SELECT LOWER(email) AS email, COUNT(*) FROM admin_users GROUP BY LOWER(email) HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
  UPDATE admin_users SET email = LOWER(email);
  ```
:::

### Wildcard Permissions

Permissions support wildcard matching. A role with `catalog.*` can access any `catalog.` permission:

```php
use Marko\AdminAuth\Contracts\PermissionRegistryInterface;

$permissionRegistry->matches('catalog.*', 'catalog.products.view');  // true
$permissionRegistry->matches('catalog.*', 'catalog.products.edit');   // true
$permissionRegistry->matches('*', 'anything.here');                   // true
$permissionRegistry->matches('catalog.products.*', 'catalog.orders'); // false
```

### Checking Permissions in Code

`AdminUserInterface` provides methods for checking permissions and roles:

```php title="OrderService.php"
use Marko\AdminAuth\Entity\AdminUserInterface;
use Marko\Routing\Exceptions\HttpException;

class OrderService
{
    public function cancel(
        AdminUserInterface $adminUser,
        int $orderId,
    ): void {
        if (!$adminUser->hasPermission('orders.cancel')) {
            throw HttpException::forbidden('Cannot cancel orders.');
        }

        if ($adminUser->hasRole('super-admin')) {
            // super admin bypass
        }
    }
}
```

### Admin User Entity

`AdminUser` implements `AdminUserInterface` and integrates with the [authentication](/docs/packages/authentication/) system:

```php title="DashboardController.php"
use Marko\AdminAuth\Entity\AdminUserInterface;
use Marko\Authentication\Contracts\GuardInterface;

readonly class DashboardController
{
    public function __construct(
        private GuardInterface $guard,
    ) {}

    public function index(): Response
    {
        $user = $this->guard->user();

        if ($user instanceof AdminUserInterface) {
            $name = $user->getName();
            $roles = $user->getRoles();
            $permissions = $user->getPermissionKeys();
        }
    }
}
```

### Events

`RoleRepository` and `AdminUserRepository` dispatch `RoleCreated`, `RoleUpdated`, `RoleDeleted`, `AdminUserCreated` and `AdminUserUpdated` after a save or delete. `AdminUserDeleted` is available for your own code to dispatch. Each event exposes `getTimestamp()`, which is a required constructor argument: the events never read the clock themselves. The repositories pass the current instant from the [`marko/database`](/docs/packages/database/) repository (`Repository::now()`, in UTC), the same instant source used for `#[Timestamps]`.

`admin-auth:permissions:sync` dispatches `PermissionsSynced` once per run, after the sync and any prune, with the time from the injected `ClockInterface`. It fires even when `--prune` is refused or cancelled, because the sync has already been written; `getPrunedCount()` is then `0`. Observe it to audit permission changes:

```php title="app/admin/src/Observers/AuditPermissionSync.php"
use Marko\AdminAuth\Events\PermissionsSynced;
use Marko\Core\Attributes\Observer;
use Marko\Log\Contracts\LoggerInterface;

#[Observer(event: PermissionsSynced::class)]
readonly class AuditPermissionSync
{
    public function __construct(
        private LoggerInterface $logger,
    ) {}

    public function handle(
        PermissionsSynced $event,
    ): void {
        $this->logger->info('Admin permissions synced', [
            'registered' => $event->getTotalCount(),
            'created' => $event->getCreatedCount(),
            'updated' => $event->getUpdatedCount(),
            'unregistered' => $event->getUnregisteredCount(),
            'pruned' => $event->getPrunedCount(),
            'at' => $event->getTimestamp()->format(DATE_ATOM),
        ]);
    }
}
```

| Getter | Returns |
|--------|---------|
| `getTotalCount()` | The number of registered permissions |
| `getCreatedCount()` | Permissions inserted |
| `getUpdatedCount()` | Existing permissions whose label or group changed |
| `getUnregisteredCount()` | Rows no longer registered, wildcard grants excluded |
| `getPrunedCount()` | Rows deleted by `--prune` (`0` without it, or when it was refused or cancelled) |

## API Reference

### AdminUserInterface

```php
interface AdminUserInterface extends AuthenticatableInterface
{
    public function getEmail(): string;
    public function getName(): string;
    public function setRoles(array $roles, array $permissionKeys = []): void;
    public function getRoles(): array;
    public function getPermissionKeys(): array;
    public function hasPermission(string $key): bool;
    public function hasRole(string $slug): bool;
}
```

### PermissionRegistryInterface

```php
interface PermissionRegistryInterface
{
    public function register(string $key, string $label, string $group): void;
    public function all(): array;
    public function getByGroup(string $group): array;
    public function matches(string $pattern, string $permissionKey): bool;
}
```

`register()` throws `AdminAuthException::invalidPermissionKey()` for a key outside the [permission key format](#keys-slugs-and-emails) and `AdminAuthException::duplicatePermission()` for a key that is already registered.

### PermissionDiscovery

```php
public function registerFromDefinitions(array $definitions): void;
public function discoverFromClass(string $className): void;
```

`registerFromDefinitions()` registers the `#[AdminPermission]` entries of the given `AdminSectionDefinition`s, grouped by the first segment of each key. The boot callback calls it with marko/admin's `DiscoveredAdminSections::all()`. `discoverFromClass()` parses one `#[AdminSection]` class and registers its permissions.

| Exception | Thrown when |
|-----------|-------------|
| `AdminAuthException::invalidPermissionKey()` | A declared key is outside the [permission key format](#keys-slugs-and-emails) (the message names the key and the section class). Nothing is registered |
| `AdminAuthException::duplicatePermission()` | Two section classes declare the same permission key (the message names both classes) |
| `AdminAuthException::permissionAlreadyRegistered()` | A key declared by `#[AdminPermission]` was already registered by hand |

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `admin-auth:permissions:sync` | Inserts missing permissions, updates changed labels and groups, and lists permissions that are no longer registered with how many roles hold each. Deletes nothing |
| `admin-auth:permissions:sync --prune` | Also deletes the unregistered permissions and their role assignments in one transaction. Never deletes a key containing `*`. Outside development and testing, needs `--force`; asks for confirmation when someone can answer |

### RequiresPermission Attribute

```php
#[RequiresPermission(permission: 'section.action')]
```

### AdminAuthMiddleware

```php
class AdminAuthMiddleware implements MiddlewareInterface
{
    public function handle(Request $request, callable $next): Response;
}
```

Throws `Marko\Authentication\Exceptions\UnauthenticatedException` with status `401` for an unauthenticated request that wants JSON or whose guard is stateless (with the guard's `WWW-Authenticate` challenge when the guard is stateless), or `Marko\Routing\Exceptions\HttpException` with status `403` for a missing permission. An unauthenticated request on a stateful guard that doesn't want JSON gets a redirect response to `{prefix}/login`; a stateless guard never redirects.

Permission enforcement relies on the router attaching route context to the request before middleware runs (see [`marko/routing`](/docs/packages/routing/) --- `Request::withRoute()`). If no route context is present, `#[RequiresPermission]` is not evaluated and the request passes through authenticated.

### Repository Interfaces

```php
interface AdminUserRepositoryInterface extends RepositoryInterface
{
    public function findByEmail(string $email): ?AdminUser;
    public function getRolesForUser(int $userId): array;
    public function syncRoles(int $userId, array $roleIds): void;
}

interface RoleRepositoryInterface extends RepositoryInterface
{
    public function findBySlug(string $slug): ?Role;
    public function getPermissionsForRole(int $roleId): array;
    /** @return array<Permission> */
    public function getPermissionsForRoles(array $roleIds): array;
    public function syncPermissions(int $roleId, array $permissionIds): void;
    public function isSlugUnique(string $slug, ?int $excludeId = null): bool;
}

interface PermissionRepositoryInterface extends RepositoryInterface
{
    public function findByKey(string $key): ?Permission;
    public function findByGroup(string $group): array;
    public function syncFromRegistry(PermissionRegistryInterface $registry): PermissionSyncResult;
    /** @return list<UnregisteredPermission> */
    public function findUnregistered(PermissionRegistryInterface $registry): array;
    /** @return list<UnregisteredPermission> */
    public function pruneUnregistered(PermissionRegistryInterface $registry): array;
}
```

`findByEmail()` lowercases the email before the lookup. `findBySlug()` and `findByKey()` return `null` for a slug or key outside the [canonical format](#keys-slugs-and-emails) without querying, and `isSlugUnique()` throws `AdminAuthException::invalidRoleSlug()` for one, since `save()` would reject it.

`syncFromRegistry()` inserts the registered permissions that are missing from the table, updates the label and group of rows that changed and renames rows whose key differs from a registered key only in case, in one transaction. It deletes nothing. It returns a `PermissionSyncResult`:

```php
readonly class PermissionSyncResult
{
    public int $registeredCount;
    public array $created;      // list<string>: keys inserted
    public array $updated;      // list<string>: keys whose label or group changed, or whose case was repaired
    public array $unregistered; // list<UnregisteredPermission>: rows no longer registered
    public array $wildcardKeys; // list<string>: keys containing `*`, kept

    public function createdCount(): int;
    public function updatedCount(): int;
    public function unregisteredCount(): int;
}

readonly class UnregisteredPermission
{
    public int $id;
    public string $key;
    public string $label;
    public string $group;
    public int $roleCount; // distinct roles holding the permission
}
```

`findUnregistered()` returns the rows whose key is not registered, sorted by key. `pruneUnregistered()` deletes those rows and their `role_permissions` rows in one `transaction()` (a savepoint inside your own transaction) and returns what it removed. Neither ever includes a key containing `*`. The deletes are SQL statements, so no `EntityDeleting` or `EntityDeleted` events fire for the removed rows. The `admin-auth:permissions:sync` command calls `syncFromRegistry()`, and `pruneUnregistered()` with `--prune`.

`getPermissionsForRoles()` returns the deduplicated permission set across all given role IDs in a single query. Empty input returns an empty array without issuing a query.

`syncPermissions()` replaces a role's permissions: it deletes the existing rows and inserts the new set in batches, all inside one `transaction()`. A failure part-way through rolls the whole sync back, so a role is never left half-synced. Called inside your own transaction, the sync runs in a savepoint. If it fails, only the sync's changes are undone, and you can catch the exception and still commit the rest of your transaction.

### AdminAuthConfigInterface

```php
interface AdminAuthConfigInterface
{
    public function getGuardName(): string;
    public function getSuperAdminRoleSlug(): string;
}
```
