description: Read/write connection splitting with replica routing for Marko database connections.
---

Read/write connection splitting with replica routing for Marko database connections. Wraps any existing [`marko/database`](/docs/packages/database/) driver connection — all write operations and transactions route to the primary, all reads route to one of your configured replicas. Uses the decorator pattern: `ReadWriteConnection` implements `ConnectionInterface` and `TransactionInterface` so the rest of the application code is unchanged.

## Installation

```bash
composer require marko/database-readwrite
```

This automatically installs `marko/database` (the interface package) as a dependency.

## Configuration

Set `driver` to `readwrite` in your `config/database.php`, then declare a `connections` block with your write primary and one or more read replicas:

```php title="config/database.php"
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Marko\Config\Env;

return [
    'driver' => 'readwrite',
    'connections' => [
        'write' => [
            'driver'   => 'pgsql',
            'host'     => Env::string('DB_WRITE_HOST', 'localhost'),
            'port'     => Env::int('DB_WRITE_PORT', 5432, min: 1, max: 65535),
            'database' => Env::string('DB_DATABASE', 'marko'),
            'username' => Env::string('DB_USERNAME', 'postgres'),
            'password' => Env::string('DB_PASSWORD', ''),
        ],
        'read' => [
            [
                'driver'   => 'pgsql',
                'host'     => Env::string('DB_READ_HOST_1', 'replica-1'),
                'port'     => Env::int('DB_READ_PORT_1', 5432, min: 1, max: 65535),
                'database' => Env::string('DB_DATABASE', 'marko'),
                'username' => Env::string('DB_USERNAME', 'postgres'),
                'password' => Env::string('DB_PASSWORD', ''),
            ],
            [
                'driver'   => 'pgsql',
                'host'     => Env::string('DB_READ_HOST_2', 'replica-2'),
                'port'     => Env::int('DB_READ_PORT_2', 5432, min: 1, max: 65535),
                'database' => Env::string('DB_DATABASE', 'marko'),
                'username' => Env::string('DB_USERNAME', 'postgres'),
                'password' => Env::string('DB_PASSWORD', ''),
            ],
        ],
        'read_strategy' => 'random',  // 'random' (default) or 'weighted'
    ],
];
```

### Config Schema

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| `connections.write` | `array` | Yes | Single write (primary) connection config |
| `connections.read` | `array[]` | Yes | One or more replica connection configs |
| `connections.read_strategy` | `string` | No | Replica selection strategy: `random` (default) or `weighted` |
| `read[n].weight` | `int` | No | Required when `read_strategy` is `weighted`; positive integer |
| `timezone` | `string` | No | Top-level [`database.timezone`](/docs/packages/database/#datetimes-and-timezones) (default `UTC`) |

Each connection config inside `write` and `read[]` follows the same structure as a standalone driver config (e.g., `marko/database-pgsql`). The time zone is the exception: every node's session is pinned to the top-level `timezone` ([the database session time zone](/docs/packages/database/#the-database-session-time-zone)), so the primary and the replicas agree. A `timezone` inside a node config is ignored.

## Replica Strategies

### Random (default)

Selects a replica uniformly at random on each read query. Use when all replicas have similar capacity:

```php title="config/database.php"
'connections' => [
    // ...
    'read_strategy' => 'random',
],
```

### Weighted

Routes a proportional share of read traffic to each replica based on its `weight`. Use when replicas have different hardware or capacity:

```php title="config/database.php"
'connections' => [
    'write' => [ /* primary config */ ],
    'read' => [
        [
            'driver' => 'pgsql',
            'host'   => 'replica-1',
            // ...
            'weight' => 3,  // receives 3/4 of reads
        ],
        [
            'driver' => 'pgsql',
            'host'   => 'replica-2',
            // ...
            'weight' => 1,  // receives 1/4 of reads
        ],
    ],
    'read_strategy' => 'weighted',
],
```

Weights are positive integers. The probability of selecting a replica equals its weight divided by the total of all weights. Each `weight` must be a positive integer or it is rejected at config parse time.

:::note
`WeightedReplicaSelector` calculates probabilities based on the original replica list. When a replica fails and is removed during a request, the weights for the remaining replicas are not rebalanced. This is a known v1 limitation.
:::

## Sticky Writes

After any write operation or transaction, subsequent reads within the same request are routed to the write connection rather than a replica. This prevents stale reads caused by replication lag.

The sticky flag is set by:

- `execute()` — any INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or DDL statement
- `query()` with an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE — a write that returns rows, such as the `INSERT ... RETURNING` a repository runs to read a [database-generated key](/docs/packages/database/#database-generated-keys) back, so a following `find()` sees the new row
- `beginTransaction()` — entering a transaction
- `transaction(callable $callback, int $attempts = 1, int|Closure|null $backoff = null)` — the entire callback, every retried attempt included, runs on the primary; when the callback completes, the sticky flag goes back to what it was before the call. A nested `transaction()` therefore leaves the outer transaction's reads on the primary.

```php
use Marko\Database\Connection\ConnectionInterface;

class OrderService
{
    public function __construct(
        private ConnectionInterface $connection,
    ) {}

    public function placeOrder(array $data): int
    {
        // Writes set the sticky flag
        $orderId = $this->connection->execute(
            'INSERT INTO orders (user_id, total) VALUES (?, ?)',
            [$data['user_id'], $data['total']],
        );

        // This query routes to the write connection (sticky), not a replica,
        // so it sees the order that was just inserted
        return $this->connection->query(
            'SELECT id FROM orders WHERE id = ?',
            [$orderId],
        )[0]['id'];
    }
}
```

Row-locking reads (`lockForUpdate()`, `sharedLock()`) must run inside a transaction, so they always reach the primary. `upsert()` is an `INSERT` and is routed to the primary too.

The sticky flag persists until `resetStickyState()` is called. In a PHP-FPM application this happens automatically because each request runs in a fresh process. In long-running processes you must call it manually (see [Long-Running Processes](#long-running-processes)).

:::caution[v1 limitation: write CTEs]
CTEs that begin with `WITH` followed by an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` are **not** detected as write statements by the automatic routing logic. `WITH ... INSERT ... RETURNING` (or similar) will route to a replica unless you use `execute()` directly, or call `beginTransaction()` / `commit()` to enter a transaction first.
:::

## `prepare()` Policy

`prepare()` always routes to the write connection. Prepared statements are typically used for bulk writes or repeated mutation patterns, so routing them to the primary is the safe default. There are no production callers of `prepare()` in the current Marko core, so this policy has no performance impact on stock setups.

## Single-Request Fallback

When a read query fails on a replica with a `PDOException` or `MarkoException`, `ReadWriteConnection` removes that replica from the candidate pool and retries the query on the next available replica. This continues until:

- A replica responds successfully, or
- All replicas are exhausted, at which point `ReadException` is thrown

```
ReadException: All replicas failed to execute the query: <replica-1 message>; <replica-2 message>
Context: While attempting to route a read query to an available replica
Suggestion: Check that at least one replica is reachable and accepting connections
```

Fallback is per-request only. The replica pool is rebuilt fresh on the next request (PHP-FPM) or the next call to `resetStickyState()` (long-running processes).

:::caution
Sticky writes (via `execute()` or `beginTransaction()`) bypass all replicas entirely --- there is no fallback path. If the write connection is unavailable the underlying driver exception is propagated directly.
:::

## Long-Running Processes

In PHP-FPM the sticky flag is cleared automatically at the end of each request because each request is a new process. In a queue worker or other long-running process the sticky flag persists for the lifetime of the process. Call `resetStickyState()` between jobs to restore replica routing:

`ReadWriteConnection` also implements `Marko\Core\Contracts\ResettableInterface`, so a worker that resets every registered `ResettableInterface` implementation between requests will clear the sticky flag automatically via `reset()`. Calling `resetStickyState()` directly remains supported for callers that don't go through the contract.

Beyond clearing the sticky flag, `reset()` also rolls back any transaction left open by a request that called `beginTransaction()` directly and then threw before `commit()`/`rollback()`. When the write connection is itself resettable (the MySQL and PostgreSQL drivers are), `reset()` delegates to it, which rolls back every nested level and drops pending after-commit callbacks. Otherwise it calls `rollback()` once per open level, innermost first. Without this, the underlying write connection stays mid-transaction on the pooled connection, and the next request's writes would silently land inside the previous request's abandoned transaction. The rollback only runs when a transaction is actually open; if the rollback itself throws, the sticky flag is still cleared before the exception propagates, so the connection is never left permanently sticky even when a reset only partially succeeds.

```php
use Marko\Database\ReadWrite\Connection\ReadWriteConnection;
use Marko\Database\Connection\ConnectionInterface;

class JobWorker
{
    public function __construct(
        private ConnectionInterface $connection,
    ) {}

    public function run(Job $job): void
    {
        try {
            $job->handle();
        } finally {
            // Always reset between jobs — even if the job threw
            if ($this->connection instanceof ReadWriteConnection) {
                $this->connection->resetStickyState();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Multi-Driver Limitation

`ReadWriteConnection` binds `ConnectionInterface` as a container instance. This is the same interface binding used by all other database drivers, so only one driver can be active at a time. You cannot, for example, have a PostgreSQL read/write split alongside a MySQL connection in the same container.

This constraint is inherited from the single-binding design of `ConnectionInterface` in `marko/database` and applies equally to `marko/database-pgsql` and `marko/database-mysql`.

## Customization

Override `ReadWriteConnection` using the [Preferences](/docs/concepts/dependency-injection/#overriding-another-modules-bindings) pattern. Define a `Preference` in your module's `module.php` to substitute your own implementation wherever `ReadWriteConnection` is resolved:

```php title="module.php"
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Marko\Database\ReadWrite\Connection\ReadWriteConnection;
use Acme\Database\ReadWrite\Connection\CustomReadWriteConnection;

return [
    'preferences' => [
        ReadWriteConnection::class => CustomReadWriteConnection::class,
    ],
];
```

Your `CustomReadWriteConnection` must extend `ReadWriteConnection` (or independently implement `ConnectionInterface` and `TransactionInterface`).

## API Reference

### ReadWriteConnection

Implements `ConnectionInterface`, `TransactionInterface`, `PendingAfterCommitInterface`, and `ResettableInterface`. Routes reads to replicas and writes to the primary.

| Method | Routes To | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `query(string $sql, array $bindings = []): array` | Read (replica or write if sticky) | Execute a SELECT and return all rows |
| `execute(string $sql, array $bindings = []): int` | Write (sets sticky) | Execute a write statement; returns affected row count |
| `prepare(string $sql): StatementInterface` | Write (always) | Prepare a statement for repeated execution |
| `lastInsertId(): int` | Write | Get the last auto-increment ID |
| `connect(): void` | Write | Establish the write connection |
| `disconnect(): void` | Write | Close the write connection |
| `isConnected(): bool` | Write | Check if the write connection is open |
| `beginTransaction(): void` | Write (sets sticky) | Start a transaction on the write connection |
| `commit(): void` | Write | Commit the current transaction |
| `rollback(): void` | Write | Roll back the current transaction |

| `transactionLevel(): int` | Write | Number of open transaction levels (savepoints included) |
| `transaction(callable $callback, int $attempts = 1, int\|Closure\|null $backoff = null): mixed` | Write (sets sticky temporarily) | Run a callback inside an auto-managed transaction (a savepoint when nested); `$attempts` and `$backoff` are passed to the write connection, which waits between attempts and retries the outermost transaction on a deadlock or serialization failure. The sticky flag is set for the callback duration and restored to its previous value afterwards |
| `afterCommit(callable $callback): void` | Write | Run the callback after the write connection's outermost commit |
| `afterRollback(callable $callback): void` | Write | Run the callback if its transaction level rolls back |
| `runPendingAfterCommitCallbacks(): void` | Write | Run the write connection's queued `afterCommit()` callbacks without committing (for test helpers such as `RefreshDatabase`); throws `TransactionException` when the write connection does not implement `PendingAfterCommitInterface` |
| `driverName(): string` | Write (delegates) | Return the write connection's driver name (e.g. `'mysql'`, `'pgsql'`) |
| `supportsReturning(): bool` | Write (delegates) | Whether the write connection supports `INSERT ... RETURNING` |
| `quoteIdentifier(string $identifier): string` | Write (delegates) | Quote a table or column name with the write connection's quoting rule |
| `resetStickyState(): void` | — | Clear the sticky flag; subsequent reads route to replicas again |
| `reset(): void` | — | `ResettableInterface` contract method; rolls back every open transaction level (delegating to a resettable write connection) and clears the sticky flag |
