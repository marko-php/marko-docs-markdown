description: Reusable fakes with built-in assertions that eliminate test boilerplate.
---

Testing utilities for Marko — reusable fakes with built-in assertions that eliminate test boilerplate. This package provides in-memory fakes for the core Marko contracts: events, broadcasting, mail, queues, sessions, cookies, logging, config, authentication, guards, HTTP clients, the clock, and console confirmations. Each fake records interactions and exposes assertion methods so your tests stay focused on behavior rather than mock setup. An in-process HTTP test client (`TestClient`) sends requests through your real routes, middleware and controllers for feature tests. Pest expectation extensions (`toHaveDispatched`, `toHaveBroadcast`, `toHaveSent`, `toHavePushed`, `toHaveLogged`, `toHaveAttempted`, `toBeAuthenticated`, `toHaveStatus`, `toHaveJsonPath`) are included for fluent assertions.

Available fakes: `FakeEventDispatcher`, `FakeBroadcaster`, `FakeMailer`, `FakeQueue`, `FakeSession`, `FakeCookieJar`, `FakeLogger`, `FakeConfigRepository`, `FakeAuthenticatable`, `FakeUserProvider`, `FakeGuard`, `FakeHttpClient`, `FakeClock`, `FakeSleeper`, `FakeConfirmationPrompter`.

## Installation

```bash
composer require marko/testing --dev
```

## Usage

### FakeEventDispatcher

```php
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeEventDispatcher;

$dispatcher = new FakeEventDispatcher();
$dispatcher->dispatch(new OrderPlaced($order));

$dispatcher->assertDispatched(OrderPlaced::class);
$dispatcher->assertDispatchedCount(OrderPlaced::class, 1);
$dispatcher->assertNotDispatched(OrderShipped::class);
```

### FakeBroadcaster

Implements `BroadcasterInterface` from [`marko/broadcasting`](/docs/packages/broadcasting/). A string channel matches by name; a `Channel`, `PrivateChannel` or `PresenceChannel` also matches its kind (public, private or presence). The optional callback receives the event data and id.

```php
use Marko\Broadcasting\PrivateChannel;
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeBroadcaster;

$broadcaster = new FakeBroadcaster();
$broadcaster->broadcast(new PrivateChannel('orders.7'), 'order.shipped', ['id' => 7]);

$broadcaster->assertBroadcast('orders.7', 'order.shipped');
$broadcaster->assertBroadcast(new PrivateChannel('orders.7'), 'order.shipped', fn (array $data) => $data['id'] === 7);
$broadcaster->assertNotBroadcast('orders.7', 'order.cancelled');
$broadcaster->assertBroadcastCount(1);
```

### FakeMailer

```php
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeMailer;

$mailer = new FakeMailer();
$mailer->send($message);

$mailer->assertSent();
$mailer->assertSent(fn (Message $m) => $m->subject === 'Welcome');
$mailer->assertSentCount(1);
$mailer->assertNothingSent();
```

### FakeQueue

```php
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeQueue;

$queue = new FakeQueue();
$queue->push(new SendEmailJob($user));

$queue->assertPushed(SendEmailJob::class);
$queue->assertPushed(SendEmailJob::class, fn ($job) => $job->userId === $user->id);
$queue->assertPushedCount(1);
$queue->assertNothingPushed();
$queue->assertNotPushed(ProcessPaymentJob::class);
```

### FakeSession

```php
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeSession;

$session = new FakeSession();
$session->start();
$session->set('user_id', 42);

expect($session->started)->toBeTrue()
    ->and($session->get('user_id'))->toBe(42)
    ->and($session->has('user_id'))->toBeTrue();

$session->destroy();
expect($session->destroyed)->toBeTrue();
```

`has()` returns `true` when a key is stored, even if its value is `null`. This matches the behavior of the production `Session` implementation.

`isModified()` reports whether data changed since `start()` (or the ID was regenerated), and `discard()` sets the public `$discarded` flag without setting `$saved` --- the two calls `SessionMiddleware` makes for [lazy persistence](/docs/packages/session/#lazy-persistence).

### FakeCookieJar

```php
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeCookieJar;

$cookies = new FakeCookieJar();
$cookies->set('remember_me', 'token-value', minutes: 60);

expect($cookies->get('remember_me'))->toBe('token-value');

$cookies->delete('remember_me');
expect($cookies->get('remember_me'))->toBeNull();
```

### FakeLogger

```php
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeLogger;
use Marko\Log\LogLevel;

$logger = new FakeLogger();
$logger->info('User logged in', ['user_id' => 1]);
$logger->error('Payment failed');

$logger->assertLogged('User logged in');
$logger->assertLogged('User logged in', LogLevel::Info);
$logger->assertNothingLogged(); // Would fail here
$logger->clear();
$logger->assertNothingLogged(); // Passes after clear
```

### FakeConfigRepository

```php
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeConfigRepository;

$config = new FakeConfigRepository([
    'app.name' => 'Marko',
    'mail.driver' => 'smtp',
    'default.cache.ttl' => 3600,
    'scopes.store_1.cache.ttl' => 7200,
]);

expect($config->getString('app.name'))->toBe('Marko')
    ->and($config->getInt('default.cache.ttl'))->toBe(3600);

$config->set('app.debug', true);
expect($config->getBool('app.debug'))->toBeTrue();
```

### FakeGuard

```php
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeAuthenticatable;
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeGuard;

$guard = new FakeGuard(name: 'web', attemptResult: true);

// Set current user directly
$user = new FakeAuthenticatable(id: 1);
$guard->setUser($user);

expect($guard->check())->toBeTrue()
    ->and($guard->id())->toBe(1);

// Simulate a login attempt
$guard->setUser(null);
$guard->attempt(['email' => 'user@example.com', 'password' => 'secret']);

$guard->assertAttempted();
$guard->assertAttempted(fn (array $creds) => $creds['email'] === 'user@example.com');

// Simulate logout
$guard->logout();
$guard->assertLoggedOut();
$guard->assertGuest();
```

### FakeClock

`FakeClock` implements the PSR-20 `Psr\Clock\ClockInterface`, so it drops into anything that takes the injected clock from [`marko/clock`](/docs/packages/clock/). It is frozen: time never moves on its own, so expiry, TTL and freshness checks can be tested at exact boundaries without `sleep()` or loose time ranges.

```php
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeClock;

$clock = new FakeClock('2026-01-01 12:00:00 UTC');
$guard = new TokenGuard($repository, $currentRequest, $clock, $userProvider);

$clock->now();                         // always 2026-01-01 12:00:00
$clock->travel('+59 minutes');         // relative move
$clock->travelTo('2026-01-02 00:00');  // absolute jump
$clock->setNow(new DateTimeImmutable('2026-06-01 09:00:00 UTC'));

$clock->assertNowIs('2026-06-01 09:00:00 UTC');
```

`travel()` accepts any `DateTimeImmutable::modify()` string; a malformed modifier throws `DateMalformedStringException`. With no argument, the fake is frozen at the moment it was created.

### FakeSleeper

`FakeSleeper` implements `Marko\Database\Connection\SleeperInterface` from [`marko/database`](/docs/packages/database/) (install it to use this fake). It records each requested delay in milliseconds instead of sleeping, so you can assert the [backoff](/docs/packages/database/#backoff) between `transaction()` retries without waiting for it:

```php
use Marko\Database\Connection\TransactionBackoff;
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeSleeper;

$sleeper = new FakeSleeper();
$connection = new PgSqlConnection($config, transactionBackoff: new TransactionBackoff($sleeper));

// ... a transaction that conflicts twice, run with attempts: 3, backoff: 50

$sleeper->assertSlept(50, 50);
$sleeper->sleeps;            // [50, 50]
$sleeper->clear();
$sleeper->assertNotSlept();
```

The connection sleeps once per retry, including a `0` delay. It never sleeps after the last attempt, with `attempts: 1`, or in a nested `transaction()`. For repeatable default (jittered) delays, pass a seeded `new Randomizer(new Mt19937($seed))` as the second `TransactionBackoff` argument.

### FakeConfirmationPrompter

`FakeConfirmationPrompter` implements core's [`ConfirmationPrompterInterface`](/docs/packages/core/#asking-for-confirmation). Script one answer per question; it records each question asked:

```php
use Marko\Core\Command\Input;
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeConfirmationPrompter;

$prompter = new FakeConfirmationPrompter(answers: [true]);
$command = new PurgeCommand($prompter);

$command->execute(new Input(['marko', 'billing:purge']), $output);

$prompter->assertAsked('Delete all archived invoices?');
$prompter->asked; // ['Delete all archived invoices?']
```

Pass `interactive: false` to test the `--no-interaction` / no-terminal path: like the real prompter, `confirm()` then asks nothing and returns its `$default`, and `assertNothingAsked()` passes. Asking more questions than answers were scripted throws `AssertionFailedException`.

### FakeAuthenticatable and FakeUserProvider

```php
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeAuthenticatable;
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeUserProvider;

$user = new FakeAuthenticatable(id: 1, password: 'hashed');
$provider = new FakeUserProvider(users: [1 => $user]);

$found = $provider->retrieveById(1);
expect($found)->toBe($user);

$valid = $provider->validateCredentials($user, ['password' => 'secret']);
expect($valid)->toBeTrue(); // Default validator always returns true

$provider->updateRememberToken($user, 'new-token');
expect($provider->lastRememberTokenUpdate['token'])->toBe('new-token');
```

### FakeHttpClient

`FakeHttpClient` implements `HttpClientInterface` from [`marko/http`](/docs/packages/http/), so any service that takes the interface can be tested without a live server or Guzzle internals.

```php
use Marko\Http\Exceptions\ConnectionException;
use Marko\Http\HttpResponse;
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeHttpClient;
use Marko\Testing\Fake\Http\RecordedRequest;

$http = new FakeHttpClient();

// Exact URL, or * as a wildcard
$http->stub('https://api.example.com/orders/*', new HttpResponse(200, '{"id":1}', ['Content-Type' => 'application/json']));
$http->stub('https://api.example.com/fail', new HttpResponse(500, 'boom'));

// Simulate a network failure
$http->stub('https://api.example.com/slow', new ConnectionException('timeout'));

// Sequential responses for requests that match no stub, whatever their URL
$http->queue(new HttpResponse(201, ''), new HttpResponse(200, ''));

$service = new OrderSync($http);
$service->push($order);

$http->assertSent(fn (RecordedRequest $r) => $r->method === 'POST' && $r->json()['id'] === 1);
$http->assertSentCount(1);
$http->assertNotSent(fn (RecordedRequest $r) => str_contains($r->url, '/fail'));
```

To fake repeated headers such as two `Set-Cookie` values, pass them as `headerValues`. The code under test reads them back with `headerValues()`, and `headers()` returns them joined with `", "`:

```php
$http->stub('https://sso.example.com/*', new HttpResponse(200, '', headerValues: [
    'Set-Cookie' => ['session=abc; Expires=Wed, 21 Oct 2026 07:28:00 GMT', 'theme=dark'],
]));
```

Each request is resolved in this order: the first registered stub whose pattern matches the URL, then the next queued response. A request that matches neither is a **stray request** and throws `AssertionFailedException`, so a test never silently talks to an unexpected endpoint. Call `$http->preventStrayRequests(false)` to answer stray requests with an empty `200` response instead.

The fake applies the same rules as a real driver:

- Options are validated with `RequestOptions::validate()`, so an unknown key such as `form_param` (or the Guzzle-only `guzzle` key) throws `InvalidRequestOptionException`.
- A stubbed 4xx/5xx response throws `HttpException` with the response attached, unless the request passes `'http_errors' => false`, in which case the `HttpResponse` is returned.

Every sent request is recorded as a readonly `RecordedRequest` in `$http->requests`, with `method` (uppercased), `url` and `options`, plus helpers:

```php
$request = $http->requests[0];

$request->header('authorization'); // case-insensitive, null when absent
$request->json();                  // the 'json' option
$request->body();                  // raw 'body', encoded 'json', or encoded 'form_params'
```

### KnownDriversValidator

`KnownDriversValidator` is a static utility for package authors to assert that a package's `known-drivers.php` file is well-formed and stays in sync with the skeleton's `suggest` block. See [Known Drivers](/concepts/known-drivers/) for the file format and description-string conventions.

```php
use Marko\Testing\KnownDrivers\KnownDriversValidator;

// Assert every key in known-drivers.php follows the 'marko/*' prefix pattern
KnownDriversValidator::assertDocsUrlsResolveToValidPattern(
    __DIR__ . '/../known-drivers.php',
);

// Assert skeleton composer.json suggest block contains every entry from known-drivers.php
KnownDriversValidator::assertSkeletonSuggestContainsAll(
    __DIR__ . '/../known-drivers.php',
    __DIR__ . '/../../skeleton/composer.json',
);
```

## HTTP Tests

`TestClient` sends requests through your application in process: the real router, global and route middleware (sessions, CSRF, auth, CORS, rate limits) and controllers all run, with no web server and no superglobals. It boots the application once and serves any number of requests, so a feature test costs about as much as a unit test.

```php
use Marko\Testing\Http\TestClient;

$client = TestClient::boot(basePath: $projectRoot); // boots the Application once

$client->get('/api/v1/shows/42')
    ->assertOk()
    ->assertJsonPath('data.status', 'live');

$client->withHeaders(['X-Request-Id' => 'abc'])
    ->postJson('/api/v1/shows/42/events', ['type' => 'view'])
    ->assertStatus(202);

$client->post('/login', ['email' => 'a@b.c', 'password' => 'secret']) // form-encoded
    ->assertRedirect('/dashboard')
    ->assertCookie('marko_session');

$client->actingAs($user)->get('/dashboard')->assertOk();
$client->withCookie('locale', 'nl')->get('/')->assertSee('Welkom');
```

Use `TestClient::forApplication($app)` to wrap an `Application` you booted yourself. `TestClient::boot()` throws when the base path does not exist.

### Pest setup

Create one client per test, so state from one test (cookies, `actingAs()`, headers) never reaches the next:

```php title="tests/Pest.php"
use Marko\Testing\Http\TestClient;

uses()->beforeEach(function () {
    $this->http = TestClient::boot(dirname(__DIR__));
})->in('Feature');
```

```php title="tests/Feature/ShowTest.php"
it('shows a live show', function () {
    $this->http->getJson('/api/v1/shows/42')
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertJsonPath('data.status', 'live');
});
```

### Sending requests

| Method | Sends |
|--------|-------|
| `get($uri, $query = [], $headers = [])`, `head(...)` | `$query` merged into the URI's query string |
| `post($uri, $data = [], $headers = [])`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`, `options` | `$data` as form fields (`Request::post()`), form-encoded |
| `postJson($uri, $data = [], $headers = [])`, `putJson`, `patchJson`, `deleteJson` | `json_encode($data)` as the body, with `Content-Type` and `Accept: application/json` |
| `getJson($uri, $query = [], $headers = [])` | A GET with `Accept: application/json`; GET carries no body, so `$query` is the query string |
| `json($method, $uri, $data = [], $headers = [])` | Any method with a JSON body |
| `call($method, $uri, $data = [], $headers = [], ?string $body = null)` | Any method; pass `$body` for a raw body (e.g. XML). Passing both form `$data` and a `$body` throws |

The client builds a `Marko\Routing\Http\Request` the way PHP would for a real request:

- Headers become `HTTP_*` server keys; `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` become `CONTENT_TYPE` and `CONTENT_LENGTH`.
- `REQUEST_METHOD`, `REQUEST_URI` (with the query string), `QUERY_STRING`, `HTTP_HOST` and `SERVER_NAME` (`localhost`, or the host of a full URL such as `https://shop.test/cart`), and `REMOTE_ADDR` (`127.0.0.1`) are set. A relative path is an HTTPS request (`HTTPS=on`, port 443). Only an explicit `http://` URL is plain HTTP.
- `withServerVariables(['REMOTE_ADDR' => '203.0.113.9'])` overrides any server key for later requests.
- Controllers read the payload exactly as in production: `$request->json('type')`, `$request->post('email')`, `$request->input('page')`.
- Requests go through the real `Router`, so its method handling is the same as in production. A `head()` response never has a body, and HEAD falls back to the GET route when no `#[Head]` route exists. An `options()` call to a path that has no `#[Options]` route returns an automatic `204` with an `Allow` header. A method the path has no route for returns `405` with `Allow`. Global middleware runs on all of these.

### Client state

The client behaves like a browser, so what you set stays set for later requests on the same client:

- `withHeaders(array)` / `withHeader($name, $value)`: sent with every later request. Headers passed to one call win for that call only.
- **Cookie jar**: cookies a response sets are stored and sent back with later requests (as request cookies and a `Cookie` header). Session-backed flows such as a form login followed by a protected page, or a CSRF token round trip, just work. `withCookie()` and `withCookies(array)` add cookies, and `withoutCookies()` empties the jar. The jar scopes cookies the way a browser does; see [Cookie scope](#cookie-scope).
- `withFile($field, $path, ?$clientFilename = null, ?$clientMediaType = null)`: uploads a copy of the file with the **next** request as a `Marko\Routing\Http\UploadedFile` (multipart). The original file is never moved. A missing file throws `TestClientException`. `$field` uses form notation, so one request can carry several files; see [File uploads](#file-uploads).

### File uploads

Name the field the way an HTML form would. The controller gets the same nested shape PHP builds from `$_FILES`:

```php title="tests/Feature/GalleryTest.php"
$client
    ->withFile('photos[]', __DIR__ . '/fixtures/beach.jpg')
    ->withFile('photos[]', __DIR__ . '/fixtures/sunset.jpg')
    ->withFile('documents[passport]', __DIR__ . '/fixtures/passport.pdf')
    ->post('/gallery')
    ->assertOk();

// In the controller:
$request->files('photos');               // [UploadedFile (beach.jpg), UploadedFile (sunset.jpg)], in order
$request->file('documents.passport');    // UploadedFile (passport.pdf)
```

- `photos[]` adds one more file to the `photos` list. `documents[passport]` nests the file under `documents`. Fields can nest further, e.g. `gallery[photos][]`.
- `withFiles('photos', [$first, $second])` sends a list of files in one call. It does the same as one `withFile('photos[]', ...)` per path.
- A plain field such as `avatar` holds one file. Calling `withFile('avatar', ...)` twice throws `TestClientException` instead of dropping the first file. Using one name in two shapes also throws: a single file and a list (`photos` and `photos[]`), or a single file and nested fields. So does a malformed name such as `photos[`.

### Cookie scope

The jar follows RFC 6265, so a test can't pass by sending a cookie that a browser would keep back:

- **Path**: a cookie set with `Path=/admin` is sent to `/admin` and `/admin/users`, but not to `/api` or `/administrator`. A cookie set without `Path` gets the directory of the request that set it: a cookie set by `/account/login` gets `/account`.
- **Domain**: requests go to `localhost` unless the URI is a full URL (`http://shop.test/cart`). A cookie set without `Domain` is sent back only to the exact host that set it. One set with `Domain=shop.test` is also sent to its subdomains. A response that sets a `Domain` that doesn't cover the request host is ignored, as a browser would ignore it.
- **Public suffixes**: a response that sets `Domain` to a public suffix, such as `Domain=co.uk` from `a.example.co.uk` or `Domain=com`, is ignored, as browsers ignore it, so a misconfigured cookie fails in the test instead of only in production. `assertCookie()` still passes, because the response did send the cookie; check `cookieJar()` to see what the client kept. When the public suffix is the request host itself (`Domain=localhost` from `localhost`), the cookie is kept as host-only. Every single-label domain counts as a public suffix, plus a built-in list of common ones (`co.uk`, `com.au`, `co.jp`, `github.io`, ...); the client doesn't ship the full [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org), so a rarer suffix is treated as an ordinary domain.
- **Secure**: a `Secure` cookie is sent only over HTTPS. A relative path such as `/dashboard` is an HTTPS request to `localhost`, so `Secure` cookies (including `marko/session`'s session cookie, which is `Secure` by default) round-trip in ordinary tests. Pass an explicit `http://` URL, or set `withServerVariables(['HTTPS' => 'off'])`, to test plain HTTP: a `Secure` cookie is then not sent.
- **Expiry**: the jar records when each cookie expires and stops sending it once that time passes. `Max-Age`, counted from when the response is received, wins over `Expires`; a `Max-Age` of zero or less, or an `Expires` already past, removes the cookie at once. Time is read from the application's bound `ClockInterface`, the same clock that sets `REQUEST_TIME` on each request, so it agrees with code that expires cookies relative to that clock. Bind a [`FakeClock`](#fakeclock) (`$client->application()->container->instance(ClockInterface::class, $clock)`) and `travel()` it to test session or remember-me expiry. With no clock bound, the client uses `marko/clock`'s `SystemClock`.
- **SameSite**: every request is same-site unless it says otherwise, so `SameSite` changes nothing by default. A request is cross-site when it sends `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site`, or, without `Sec-Fetch-Site`, an `Origin` header whose site (registrable domain) differs from the target host's, or `Origin: null`. A cross-site request never carries `SameSite=Strict` cookies, and carries `SameSite=Lax` cookies only on `GET`. Cookies with `SameSite=None`, or with no `SameSite` attribute, are always sent (the client follows RFC 6265 here, not Chrome's Lax-by-default).
- **Same name**: cookies are stored per name, domain and path, so `token` on `/admin` and `token` on `/api` are separate cookies. A request that matches both gets both in its `Cookie` header, the more specific path first, and `$request->cookie('token')` returns that first one, as PHP does. When a response expires a cookie, only the cookie with that name, domain and path is removed.

`withCookie($name, $value, $path = '/', ?$domain = null, $secure = false)` adds a cookie that is sent to every host unless you pass `$domain`. A response that sets or expires a cookie with the same name and path replaces it. `cookies()` returns the cookies whose path is `/` (whatever their host or `Secure` flag) as name => value pairs. `cookieJar()` returns every cookie as a `Marko\Testing\Http\JarCookie`, with its `name`, `value`, `domain`, `path`, `secure`, `hostOnly`, `expiresAt` and `sameSite` properties. Both `cookies()` and `cookieJar()` first drop the cookies that have expired on the bound clock:

```php title="tests/Feature/AdminTest.php"
$client->post('/admin/login', ['email' => 'admin@example.com', 'password' => 'secret']);

$client->get('/admin/dashboard')->assertOk();
$client->get('/api/me')->assertStatus(401); // the /admin cookie is not sent here

expect($client->cookieJar()[0]->path)->toBe('/admin');

// A cross-site form post does not carry the SameSite=Lax session cookie
$client->post('/admin/users/1/delete', headers: ['Origin' => 'https://evil.example'])
    ->assertRedirect('/admin/login');
```

:::caution
With an explicit `http://` URL, a `Secure` session cookie (the `marko/session` default) is not sent back, so a login doesn't carry over to the next request. Use relative paths or `https://` URLs for session flows, or set `'secure' => false` under `cookie` in your test environment's session config.
:::

### Acting as a user

`actingAs($user, ?string $guard = null)` authenticates every later request as `$user` without a login request and without writing to the session. It puts a `FakeGuard` holding the user in place of the guard named `$guard` (the default guard from `config/authentication.php` when `null`) in the application's `AuthManager`; for the default guard, the container's `GuardInterface` is replaced as well. `AuthMiddleware` and any controller that injects `GuardInterface` or `AuthManager` see the user.

```php
use Marko\Testing\Fake\FakeAuthenticatable;

$this->http->actingAs(new FakeAuthenticatable(id: 7))
    ->get('/dashboard')
    ->assertOk();

$this->http->actingAs($apiUser, 'api')->getJson('/api/me')->assertOk();
```

`actingAs()` needs the `marko/authentication` module loaded by the application.

### Request-scoped state and exceptions

Before each request, the client calls `reset()` on every resolved `ResettableInterface` service (`Marko\Core\RequestStateResetter`, the same code the RoadRunner worker runs), so the session, the session guard and similar request-scoped state never leak from one request to the next.

An exception thrown by a controller or middleware propagates out of `$client->get()`, so the test shows the real stack trace. HTTP exceptions (`HttpExceptionInterface`, e.g. `HttpException::notFound()`) are rendered into a response by the router, exactly as in production, so `assertNotFound()` and friends work on them.

The client opens no database connections of its own.

### Assertions

Requests return a `Marko\Testing\Http\TestResponse`. Every assertion returns the response, so they chain, and throws `AssertionFailedException` on failure. The message includes the response status and the first 500 bytes of the body:

```
Expected response status 200 but got 500.

Response status: 500
Response body: {"message":"Internal Server Error"}
```

- Status: `assertStatus($status)`, `assertOk()`, `assertCreated()`, `assertNoContent()` (also checks the body is empty), `assertUnauthorized()`, `assertForbidden()`, `assertNotFound()`, `assertUnprocessable()`
- Redirects: `assertRedirect(?string $to = null)` checks for a 3xx status with a `Location` header, matching `$to` exactly when given
- Headers (names are case-insensitive): `assertHeader($name, ?$value = null)`, `assertHeaderMissing($name)`
- Cookies the response sets: `assertCookie($name, ?$value = null)`, `assertCookieMissing($name)`
- Body: `assertSee($text)`, `assertDontSee($text)` (raw substring, not HTML-escaped)
- JSON (dot paths, with numeric segments for list items: `data.items.0.id`):
  - `assertJson(array $subset)`: the body contains the subset, compared recursively
  - `assertExactJson(array $data)`: the body equals the data; object key order is ignored
  - `assertJsonPath($path, $expected)`: the value at the path is identical (`===`) to `$expected`
  - `assertJsonCount($count, ?$path = null)`: the root, or the array at the path, has `$count` items
  - `assertJsonMissingPath($path)`: the path does not exist

A body that is not valid JSON fails a JSON assertion with a clear message. The accessors `status()`, `body()`, `header($name)`, `json(?$path = null)` and `response()` (the wrapped `Response`) are available for anything else.

## Database Tests

Database tests need `marko/database` and a driver. `marko/testing` only suggests them:

```bash
composer require --dev marko/database-pgsql   # or marko/database-mysql
```

`TestDatabase::boot($basePath)` boots your application once per process (the same `Application::boot()` that `TestClient::boot()` uses) and applies the committed migrations once with `Migrator::migrate()`. Every later call for the same base path returns the same instance, so a suite pays for boot and migrations once, not once per test. Pair it with one of two isolation strategies:

| Strategy | Per test | Use it for |
|----------|----------|------------|
| `RefreshDatabase` | Opens a transaction before the test and rolls it back after | Almost everything. It is the fast default |
| `TruncateDatabase` | Empties every entity table | Code that must see committed data: a queue worker, a second process, or a test of the commit itself |

### Test environment

The helpers refuse to run in production, and an unset `APP_ENV` counts as production. Set the environment for the test run and point `config/database.php` at a dedicated test database:

```xml title="phpunit.xml"
<php>
    <env name="APP_ENV" value="testing"/>
    <env name="DB_DATABASE" value="myapp_test"/>
</php>
```

Migrating the database (`TestDatabase::boot()`) and `RefreshDatabase` run in any environment except production, because they leave existing data in place. Operations that delete data (`TruncateDatabase::truncate()` and `fresh: true`) run only when the environment is `testing` or `test`. Production, development (`development`, `dev`, `local`), `staging`, `qa` and any other name, including a typo, are refused, because only a testing environment shows that the database is disposable. If `MARKO_ENV` is set, it takes precedence over `APP_ENV`.

This follows the [destructive-command policy](/docs/packages/database/#environment-behaviour) of the `db:*` commands, but is stricter: development is refused too, and there is no `--force` to override it.

### RefreshDatabase

```php title="tests/Pest.php"
use Marko\Testing\Database\RefreshDatabase;
use Marko\Testing\Database\TestDatabase;

uses()
    ->beforeEach(function () {
        $this->database = TestDatabase::boot(dirname(__DIR__));
        $this->refresh = new RefreshDatabase($this->database);
        $this->refresh->begin();
        $this->http = $this->database->client();
    })
    ->afterEach(function () {
        $this->refresh->rollback();
    })
    ->in('Feature');
```

```php title="tests/Feature/ShowTest.php"
use App\Shows\Repository\ShowRepository;

it('publishes a show', function () {
    $this->http->postJson('/api/v1/shows', ['slug' => 'opening-night'])->assertCreated();

    $shows = $this->database->application()->container->get(ShowRepository::class);

    expect($shows->findOneBy(['slug' => 'opening-night']))->not->toBeNull();
});
```

- Every repository, query builder and service shares one connection, so the test transaction covers all of their writes.
- Code under test that calls `transaction()` gets a savepoint and behaves as in production: an inner rollback undoes only its own work.
- `rollback()` also rolls back any savepoints the code under test left open. If the rollback itself fails, the connection is reset before the error is rethrown, so the next test can still begin.
- Create HTTP clients with `$this->database->client()`. It returns a `TestClient` on the shared application that leaves the connection alone between requests. A client from `TestClient::boot()` boots a second application with its own connection and never sees the test transaction.
- On PostgreSQL, a failed statement outside a nested `transaction()` aborts the whole test transaction, and later statements in that test fail. Wrap code that is expected to hit a constraint in `transaction()`, the way production code should.

PHPUnit test cases call the same methods from `setUp()` and `tearDown()`:

```php
use Marko\Testing\Database\RefreshDatabase;
use Marko\Testing\Database\TestDatabase;
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class ShowRepositoryTest extends TestCase
{
    private RefreshDatabase $refresh;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        $this->refresh = new RefreshDatabase(TestDatabase::boot(dirname(__DIR__, 2)));
        $this->refresh->begin();
    }

    protected function tearDown(): void
    {
        $this->refresh->rollback();
    }
}
```

#### After-commit callbacks

The test transaction never commits, so `afterCommit()` callbacks queued by the code under test do not run on their own. Run them when the test needs to assert on them:

```php
$service->publish('opening-night');   // queues a notification with afterCommit()

$this->refresh->runAfterCommitCallbacks();

expect($queue)->toHavePushed(SendShowPublished::class);
```

The callbacks run as though the outermost transaction had committed, but nothing is committed. `afterRollback()` callbacks registered by the code under test run when `rollback()` ends the test.

### TruncateDatabase

```php
use Marko\Testing\Database\TestDatabase;
use Marko\Testing\Database\TruncateDatabase;

beforeEach(function () {
    $this->database = TestDatabase::boot(dirname(__DIR__, 2));
    new TruncateDatabase($this->database)->truncate();
});
```

`truncate()` empties the tables of every `#[Table]` entity the application discovers, and restarts their identity sequences. On PostgreSQL it runs one `TRUNCATE ... RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE`. On MySQL it truncates table by table with foreign key checks switched off. The `migrations` table, and tables created only by hand-written migrations, are left alone. It throws inside an open transaction, so don't combine it with `RefreshDatabase` in the same test, and it runs only in a testing environment (see [Test environment](#test-environment)).

### Fresh schema

`TestDatabase::boot($basePath, fresh: true)` rolls back every migration and runs them again on the first boot of the process, like `db:rebuild`. Use it when the schema has drifted, for example from an environment flag in `tests/Pest.php`:

```php
TestDatabase::boot(dirname(__DIR__), fresh: getenv('DB_FRESH') === '1');
```

Pass the same `fresh` value on every call; a different value for a base path that is already booted throws. Because it deletes all data, `fresh: true` runs only in a testing environment (see [Test environment](#test-environment)).

### Seeding rows

`seedTable()` and `getTableRowCount()` insert and count raw rows through the shared connection, so they are covered by the test transaction too:

```php
$this->database->seedTable('venues', [
    ['name' => 'Paradiso', 'city' => 'Amsterdam'],
]);

expect($this->database->getTableRowCount('venues'))->toBe(1);
```

To build entities, use [entity factories](/docs/packages/database/#entity-factories) or plain `new`.

## Pest Expectations

The expectations register automatically. `marko/testing` declares a Pest plugin (`Marko\Testing\Pest\ExpectationsPlugin`) under `extra.pest.plugins` in its `composer.json`, and Pest boots it once `expect()` exists, including in `--parallel` workers. There is nothing to add to `Pest.php`.

The expectations need Pest 4 (`composer require --dev pestphp/pest`). The fakes and their `assert*()` methods work with plain PHPUnit.

:::note
If an expectation such as `toHavePushed` is reported as an undefined method, Pest's plugin list is stale. Run `composer dump-autoload` to regenerate `vendor/pest-plugins.json`, and make sure `pestphp/pest-plugin` is allowed under `config.allow-plugins`.
:::

Use them in tests:

```php
expect($dispatcher)->toHaveDispatched(OrderPlaced::class);
expect($broadcaster)->toHaveBroadcast('orders.7', 'order.shipped');
expect($mailer)->toHaveSent();
expect($mailer)->toHaveSent(fn (Message $m) => $m->to === 'user@example.com');
expect($queue)->toHavePushed(SendEmailJob::class);
expect($logger)->toHaveLogged('Payment failed');
expect($logger)->toHaveLogged('Payment failed', LogLevel::Error);
expect($http)->toHaveSentRequest();
expect($http)->toHaveSentRequest(fn (RecordedRequest $r) => $r->url === 'https://api.example.com/orders');

// TestResponse
expect($response)->toHaveStatus(201);
expect($response)->toHaveJsonPath('data.status', 'live');
```
